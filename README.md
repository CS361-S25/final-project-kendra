This project attempts to replicate the results of the paper 'Directed Evolution of Communication and Cooperation in Digital Organisms'. Each organism has a unique cell-ID and can send and retrieve messages. Although my project does not reward or punish organisms for the message value, the original paper attempts to evolve the behavior of organisms sending messages such that messages eventually carry the largest cell-ID. Each grid square represents an organism, and the coloration represents the largest message value that the organism has sent in the last 100 iterations. Red represents a larger value while blue represents a smaller value.
