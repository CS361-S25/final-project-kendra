doc << "<p>" << "This project attempts to replicate the results of the paper Directed Evolution of Communication and Cooperation in Digital Organisms” Each organism has a unique cell-ID and can send and retrieve messages. The project attempts to evolve the behavior of organisms sending messages such that messages eventually carry the largest cell-ID. Each grid square represents an organism, and the coloration represents the largest message value that the organism has sent in the last 100 iterations. Red represents a larger value while blue represents a smaller value. " << "</p></div>";
